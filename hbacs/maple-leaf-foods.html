              <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Capacity for Change</h4>
              <p class="">
                Maple Leaf Foods is a leading meat and beef processing company in Canada, supplying food products to major Canadian and US grocery stores. The company’s size, resources, and broad network of stakeholders puts it in an excellent position to address the sustainability issues associated with beef production and processing. Additionally, since Maple Leaf is a private company without external shareholders, they are better positioned to take a long-term sustainability strategy rather than a focus on the bottom line. 
              </p>
              <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Core Values </h4>
              <p class="">
                  Throughout its history, Maple Leaf’s business strategy and productive practice have been guided by their core values: 
                  <ol>
                    <li>Do What’s Right </li>
                    <li>Deliver Winning Results </li>
                    <li>Build Collaborative Teams</li>
                    <li>Get things done in a fact based, disciplined way</li>
                    <li>Learn and Grow, Inwardly and Outwardly</li>
                    <li>Dare to be Transparent & Humble</li>
                  </ol>                  
                  These demonstrate Maple Leaf’s interest in solutions that take into consideration the negative externalities of their business. Maple Leaf’s goal is not to maximize their revenue, but rather to operate their business in a way that delivers a positive impact to their stakeholders. At its core, Maple Leaf wants to contribute to a global food system that can “survive and thrive for generations to come”.

              <h4 class="site__secondary_title">Lightlife Products</h4>
              <p class="">
                  Maple Leaf has already begun taking steps to reduce their production of beef by offering entirely meatless protein alternatives that can compete directly with traditional meat on flavour, quality, texture, and appearance. These products are made entirely from plant-based material which have a significantly lower environmental impact than beef-based products. The Lightlife line offers a substitute to consumers who are increasingly seeking plant-based proteins. As this product line grows it can help Maple Leaf improve its sustainability by refocusing away from resource intensive livestock production, towards alternatives that are less dependent on water, land, and air.
